About
-----

OpenPlayHouse (OPH for fast typing) is an Open Hardware project launched by LD
Workshop.LD Workshop is a maker place where you can lasercut, 3D print and create every
idea you have in mind. Located in France (Saint-Étienne), this workshop has
started in 2013 and is owned by Loyc DESFARGES (me). OPH idea is born because,
as many makers, I have kids who love to play, play, and... play. So I decided
to creat this kind of dollhouse you can make, paint, personnalize, modify...
As it's an open hardware project, feel free to use it, share it and make it
better! Please don't forget to share your improvments, new furnitures,
corrections with me at oph@ldworkshop.fr.

OPH is to be made of MDF (Medium Density Fiber wood). Of course, feel free to try it with 
any other material. My drawings are optimized for 3 mm thickness MDF. If you want to cut 
it in another thikness, you will have to correct size of every hole where another piece will 
be inserted.

As I have a laser-cutter, I designed this project to be lasercut. If you don't own a laser-
cutter, I'm sure you can go to your local maker place, Fab-Lab, workshop... with the PDF 
files. Each PDF files is a vector file, it means you can import it in a vector software to use it
with a laser-cutter.

Some furniture parts must be 3Dprint. Same thing, if you don't have a 3D printer, i'm sure 
you can find one locally.
If you can't find anyone able to lasercut and 3D print, LD Workshop can do it for you and 
ship the pieces.

Have fun creating the OPH and I hope your kids will have as much fun playing with it.


Bill of material
----------------
To create an OPH, you'll need :
* A laser cutter.
* 3 mm MDF(Medium Density Fiber wood) – approx. 1000 mm x 1500 mm.
* 3 mm acrylic (transparent and opaque acrylic are used) – approx. 100 mm x 300
  mm. For some furniture (TV for example, 2mm acrylic is advised but 3mm can
  work too)
* Black cardboard 0,3 to 1mm thick – Approx 100 mm x 100 mm.
* A 3D printer (I used PLA filament but you can do it with other material)
* Some papersand (a thin one : about 80-120)
* Wood glue to assemble MDF parts
* Regular hobby glue (multi-use glue) to assemble acrylic and PLA parts
* for the main door, you will need to drill a very small hole (approx 1mm diameter)
* 2 small nails
* Paint, brushes, wall paper... and whatever you want to use to personalize your
  OPH.Drawings--------You can find every needed drawings into the `STL` folder.  
OpenPlayHouse.skp file includes 3D views of all part, 2D views and instructions.  
To open this file, you'll need Sketchup Make http://www.sketchup.com/download.

* STL files are for 3D printing.
* PDF files contains vector drawings and instructions.

If you see any mistake in those drawings, thank you for letting me know.
